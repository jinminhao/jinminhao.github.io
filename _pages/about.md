I am a ECE PhD student at Princeton University. I'm generally interested in the intersection of Computer Networks, Machine Learning, Security and Privacy.

I obtained my MS degree at Carnegie Mellon University. I was advised by Prof. Vyas Sekar and Prof. Giulia Fanti on privacy-preserving data sharing for networking traces. I got my BS degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
