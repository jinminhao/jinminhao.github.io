I am a PhD student at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) advised by Prof. [Maria Apostolaki](https://netsyn.princeton.edu/people/maria-apostolaki). I'm generally interested in the intersection of Computer Networks, Machine Learning, Security and Privacy.

I obtained my MS degree at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) where I was advised by Prof. [Vyas Sekar](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~vsekar/) and Prof. [Giulia Fanti](https://gfanti.github.io/website/). I was mainly working on privacy-preserving data sharing for networking traces. I got my BS degree at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).
